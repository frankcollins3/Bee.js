// open to name changes, just been saving JS-language considerations.

proposed JS quirks:
allPageArrays()                         prolly nevermind but maybe easier to start making new javascript methods by making the bad ones. 


Similarly? to how NextJS abstracts routing with pages folder
maybe  abstract modularization with a /functions folder. Maybe with <Context/> | <Native-Innovation> Leveraging main-file-root/paths 
<ContextProvider-Functions>

[BSS]/BEE-CSS
utility/tool stories:
* Allows {object} to define multiple :pseudo-classes (like on a button) --> :focus, :hover, :disabled       { hover: '', disabled: '' }
:engage -> style rules that invoke upon any activity-based-pseudo-class // that distinction leaves out -> ::before ::after?

The redundancy that led to this consideration can be seen below:
 :hover, :focus will have the same exact props/style-rules for either pseudoclass. 
they distinguish only by {cursor: pointer} considered an {.input} class but it has it's own similar rules that have to be changed. 
```
.input:hover{
    cursor: pointer;
    outline: none;
    border: 1px dashed $dedede;
    background-color: invisible;                                
    font-weight: bolder;
}

.input:focus{
    cursor: none;
    outline: none;
    border: 1px dashed $dedede;
    background-color: invisible;                                
    font-weight: bolder;
}
```

üëç spitballing but maybe allow pseudo-class in a code block:
```
#starsHeaderUnlockIcon {
    height: 50px;
    üëç :hover { cursor: pointer; } 
}
#starsHeaderUnlockIcon:hover { cursor: pointer; }
```

no :pseudo-class in Sass but can do @mixin
noting nonfeasability of @mixin::pseudo
```
class {
   {...otherClass}
   prop: value;
}
```

// seeing redux play soundfiles but with a "non-serializable-data" error // non-breaking


doWhile / useEffect seem like this but a do If() loop. nothing more specific past the name.  
do if([
        
])

 // lmaooo attempting-startup thoughts:
 some of us are "do if" people maybe we should be "do for" .... * thinks about any feasability in a do for loop lmao * 

LOLOLOLOLOL!! the Do-For Loop:
JS 2d-Matrix. Create array of arrays and it will execute a coding-statement, per array, till for block met (maybe) lol. 

// update: if it was modeled after the useEffect, a differentiating factor could be exportable/modularized useEffect()


// if it's not redundant yet to say this is wall of spitballs here goes another:
[chained_destructurin]
// imagine chained destructuring which would shorthand, not shortchange, this below set of unfoldsome actions
        const { commentFunctions, AWSfunctionsS3 } = useContentFunction()
