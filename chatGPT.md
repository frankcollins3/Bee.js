I think your idea sounds intriguing and could definitely spark interest among developers. Hereâ€™s a more polished and detailed version of what you might want to post on your GitHub:

Modular Function Exporter with Context and Native Innovation
Concept:

Just like Next.js abstracts routing with a pages folder, imagine a framework that abstracts modularization with a /functions folder.
Leveraging a main-file-root/paths structure with <ContextProvider-Functions> for better organization and modularity.
Example:

jsx
Copy code
import { createContext, useContext } from 'react';

// ContextProvider-Functions
const ContentContext = createContext();

const contentFunctions = {
  commentFunctions: {
    submitSoundCommentThought: (
      mapItemComment = null,
      commenterCanDetermineCheckboxCheckpointArray = [],
      soundCommentFile = null,
      newCommentThoughtsOk,
      newCommentStarrable,
      newCommentStarsShowAvg,
      newCommentStarsShowUsers
    ) => {
      // function implementation
    }
  }
};

const ContentProvider = ({ children }) => (
  <ContentContext.Provider value={contentFunctions}>
    {children}
  </ContentContext.Provider>
);

export const useContent = () => useContext(ContentContext);
export default ContentProvider;
CSS Utility/Tool Stories: BEE-CSS
Concept:

Define multiple pseudo-classes within a single object, allowing for cleaner and more maintainable CSS.
Example:

css
Copy code
.input:hover,
.input:focus {
  cursor: pointer;
  outline: none;
  border: 1px dashed #dedede;
  background-color: transparent;
  font-weight: bolder;
}
Non-Opinionated BLOB-Accepting Native Global State
Concept:

Handling non-serializable data in global state without breaking the app, inspired by Redux's approach.
Problem Addressed:

Error when trying to play sound files with Redux due to non-serializable data.
New Loop Concept: doWhile / useEffect
Concept:

A do-if loop, similar to useEffect but with specific conditional logic.
This format presents your ideas clearly and concisely, highlighting the innovative aspects and providing examples for clarity. It should be attractive to developers looking for new patterns and tools to improve their projects. Sharing this on GitHub can invite collaboration and feedback from the community.
